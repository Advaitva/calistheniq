Ultimate Prompt: Freemium Calisthenics Website with AI Voice Coaching
Role & Context:
*"You are a senior full-stack developer (15+ years experience) building a no-frills, user-friendly calisthenics platform with a veteran trainer. The website requires zero subscriptions—users input basic metrics, get instant workout plans, and dive into AI-guided live sessions with voice callouts and visual demos."*

Key Features:
1. Zero-Barrier Onboarding
3-Step Quick Start:

Name + Fitness Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced).

Body Metrics (Height/Weight) + Goals (Strength/Flexibility/Endurance).

Daily Time Availability (e.g., "15 mins" or "45 mins").

No accounts required (progress saved locally via browser storage).

2. Instant AI-Generated Workouts
Algorithm: Uses inputs to generate a plan in <10 seconds.

Example: "30yo, 175cm, 75kg, Intermediate, 20 mins/day → Day 1: 5 Rounds (10 Pull-Ups, 20 Push-Ups, 30s Plank)."

Workday vs. Weekend:

Workdays: High-density routines (e.g., EMOMs* or circuits).

Weekends: Skill-focused (e.g., handstand progressions) + mobility drills.

3. Voice-Guided Live Training
AI Voice Coach:

Real-time cues ("3... 2... 1... Switch to Push-Ups!").

Form tips ("Keep your core tight during L-sits!").

Visual Aids:

Sidebar with looping GIFs/3D animations of each exercise.

Timer + progress bar (e.g., "4/8 exercises completed").

4. Progress Tracking
Post-Workout Feedback:

Quick survey ("How was today’s difficulty? 👍 👎").

Auto-logged metrics (reps/sets completed).

Simple Dashboard:

Weekly consistency heatmap.

Strength trends (e.g., "Push-Up Max: 12 → 15 in 2 weeks").

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js + GSAP (animations) + Web Speech API (AI voice).

Backend: Firebase Anonymous Auth (optional) + LocalStorage fallback.

Media: Lottie (animated exercise demos) + FFmpeg (audio processing).

Sample Output Request:
*"Provide a JSON structure for a 15-min EMOM workout (exercises, durations, AI voice scripts) and a visual mockup of the live training view (timer + GIF demo + voice toggle). Highlight how the AI adjusts for a user who fails reps mid-session."*

3 Unique Selling Points (USPs):
Zero Commitment: No logins, no payments—just workouts.

Voice-Powered Coach: AI trainer mimics 1:1 session energy.

Adapts on the Fly: Skips/extends sets based on real-time performance.

Tone: "Like a military drill sergeant in your pocket—minimal setup, maximal intensity."

Refinements?
Prioritize mobile-first UI (big buttons, swipeable exercise cards).

Add a "Demo Mode" for first-time users to preview voice/visual features.

Use TTS (Text-to-Speech) libraries like Amazon Polly for natural AI voice.
