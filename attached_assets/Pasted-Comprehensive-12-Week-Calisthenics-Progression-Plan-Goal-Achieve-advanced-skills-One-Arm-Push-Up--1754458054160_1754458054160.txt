Key Coaching Tips
Tempo Control:

Use 2010 tempo (2s down, 0 pause, 1s up, 0 pause) for hypertrophy.

Slow eccentrics (4-5s) for strength gains.

Form Checks:

Record side-view videos to avoid sagging/piking.

For Pistol Squats: Prevent knee valgus by gripping the floor with toes.

Recovery:

Sleep 7-8 hours/night.

Hydrate (3L/day) and prioritize protein (1.6g/kg bodyweight).

Note: Adjust rest times if needed (e.g., 180s for heavy sets). Track workouts in a journal. If you miss a progression trigger, repeat the level.

Final Note: Consistency > intensity. Celebrate small wins (e.g., first Scapula Pull-Up, deeper squat ROM). By Week 12, you’ll own the foundational strength for advanced calisthenics skills!
